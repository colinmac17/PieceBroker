                Piece Broker is an app that helps people make decisions about food.
                <br>
                <br> ...You've been hanging out with friends, family or significant others looking for a place to eat, but with so many great choices out there, it can sometimes be challenging for everyone to agree.
                <br>
            </p>
                <p class="flow-text" id="opinion">We don't think this should ever happen.</p>
                
                <p class="flow-text">Piece Broker eliminates the need for an argument while also adding levity—and a little fun—to the process of choosing a place to eat. After asking three simple questions, our web app helps the user with this process by providing a single restaurant recommendation based on their search criteria.
                <br> That recommendation is sent back to the app and displayed for the user. From there, the user can checkout the restaurant details and even see a log of restaurants they have matched with.
                <br>
                <br> From start to finish, it's fun, a decision is made (avoiding the argument all together), and action can be taken based on the result. Skip the argument, skip the line.
