# PieceBroker

PieceBroker is an app that helps people make decisions about food.
    
We've all been with friends, family, or significant others deciding on a place to eat, but with so many amazing choices out there, it can sometimes be challenging for everyone to agree.
    
We've got a fix for that.
    
PieceBroker eliminates indecision by making the process of choosing a place to eat as simple as possible â€” after answering three simple questions, a decision is made.
    
From start to finish, it's fun, a decision is made (avoiding any arguments!), and action can be taken based on the result. Find food fast and skip the argument.
