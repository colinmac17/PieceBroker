# PieceBroker

We've all been with friends, family, or significant others deciding on a place to eat, but with so many amazing choices out there, it can sometimes be challenging for everyone to agree on a place.
    
We sought to fix that: enter PieceBroker, an app that helps people make decisions about food.
    
It eliminates indecision by making the process of choosing a place to eat as simple as possible â€” after answering three simple questions involving your location, preferred food type, and budget for the meal, that decision is made _for_ you. Now wasn't that easy?
    
From start to finish, it's quick, a decision is made (avoiding any arguments!), and action can be taken based on the result, breaking down one less step between you and food. 

PieceBroker: Find food fast and skip the argument.
